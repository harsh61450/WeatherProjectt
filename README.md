Real-Time Weather Display Program 📄 Project Description The Real-Time Weather Display Program is a Python-based application that fetches and displays live weather data for any user-defined city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve details like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed. The project demonstrates the practical application of Python programming and API integration, making it a great learning experience for beginners in coding.

🏆 Objectives To create an interactive Python program to retrieve live weather data. To integrate the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather information. To process and display weather data in a user-friendly format. 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Python 3.x: The programming language used to develop the application. Requests Library: For making HTTP requests to the weather API. OpenWeatherMap API: To fetch weather data. 📋 Requirements Python 3.x installed on your system. requests library installed. Use the command: bash Copy code pip install requests OpenWeatherMap API key. 🚀 How to Run the Program Clone or Download the Repository Download the program file to your local machine.

Set Up Your API Key

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap. Obtain an API key from your account. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the program with your actual API key. Run the Program Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the program file, and execute:

bash Copy code python weather_program.py Enter the City Name Input the name of a city when prompted, and the program will display its real-time weather details.

🖥️ Example Output yaml Copy code Enter city name: Mumbai
City: Mumbai
Temperature: 30°C
Weather: clear sky
Humidity: 70%
Wind Speed: 3.6 m/s
📉 Limitations Requires an active internet connection to fetch weather data. Restricted to cities recognized by the OpenWeatherMap API. Free-tier API keys may have usage limits. 🌟 Features for Future Enhancements Add unit conversion options (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit). Include a graphical user interface (GUI). Extend the program to display weather forecasts. 📝 License This project is for educational purposes only. It is free to use and share.
